Summary

This chapter helps or guides you on how to contribute code successfully to a project and also how to manage a project with a number of developers contributing.

Git's distributed nature of workflows allows flexibility in project collaborations. Every developer in Git is both a node and a hub. This means that they can both contribute to a repository and have their own at the same time where other developers can contribute to. This allows "a vast range of workflow possibilities" for projects and for the team of developers. 

Centralized Workflow
