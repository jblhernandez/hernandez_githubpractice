Summary

This chapter focuses now more on the collaboration with other people in working with projects through Git. The preference of offline access and common repository reliability bring about the need to make or set up an intermediate repository that you and everyone else you're working with can have access to, and where you can all push to and pull from.

Since protocols need to be chosen in running a server in Git, the first part of this chapter discusses the available protocols, including the pros and cons of each. The typical ways of setting up these protocols to get your Git server running are discussed in the succeeding parts or sections. The last part covers some hosted options, if one prefers to host their code on another's server instead of setting up and managing their own server.
