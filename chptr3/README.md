Summary

This chapter discusses what some people call Git's "killer feature," Git's branching. It is special in a way that it is "incredibly lightweight," its branching operations "instantaneous," and back and forth switching between brances fast. And "unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often, even multiple times in a day." Branching and basic merging are thoroughly discussed in this chapter.
