Summary

Version Control records and manages changes over time of projects being worked on by either one person or a collaboration of people who are most likely going to access and edit the same version of a program or project. Version control is important to use since it can revert back to any state that it has undergone, if in case the developers face problems and would want to go back to an older version that is running and has still no major errors or have little debugging to do. 

Types of Version Control Systems include Local VCSs, which had a simple database wherein all file changes are kept under revision control. Another type, Centralized Version Control Systems, which have a single server containing all the versions of the file and a number of clients that check out the these files from that server. It can be said though that Distributed Version Control Systems beat all the other two. This type of Version Control System fully mirror or clone the repository; a backup of all the data contained.
